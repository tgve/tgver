# What is TGVE?
The Turing Geovisualisation Engine (TGVE or eAtlas) is a web-based, interactive visual analytics tool for geospatial data analysis, built using R & React. The visual views and interaction mechanisms designed into the tool is underpinned by empirically-informed guidelines around visualization design and techniques from Geographic Information Science (GIScience).

# tgver

This is the R package for TGVE front end `npm` package [`tgve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eatlas). The R package is developed to facilitate interactive geospatial analysis and visualization in R, use R's echo-system to drive advanced data processing, and facilitate deployment of geospatial web applications in production.

## Install
For now whilst working towards submitting it to CRAN, please use devtools:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tgve/tgver")
```

## Use
Overall, as of this pre-CRAN release, the package takes advantage of how TGVE can be used (see this [Wiki](https://github.com/tgve/eAtlas/wiki/Using-TGVE) entry) and provides options to R users.

For instance, this document is a Markdown (GitHub) document generated using an Rmarkdown (Rmd) document, if the Rmd is rendered to a HTML output, then using `knitr::include_url` we should see an instance of the TGVE embedded in the document. Please see the live examples in the [vignette](https://tgve.github.io/tgver/articles/tgver.html) which is rendered to HTML.

To do this we can go:
```{r static, eval=FALSE}
# this is the most basic use
# tgver::tgve()
# to embed in a html rendered Rmd
html.file = tgver::tgve(browse = FALSE)
knitr::include_url(html.file)
```
The first function `tgver::tgve(browse=FALSE)` prepares an instance of the TGVE but does not run/open it, it returns its path (a `tempdir()` path). The second line is `knitr` function to embed the first line's output. 

That was the simplest way of running an instance of TGVE on the local machine. The more advanced but similar function of this package, with the back-end as a `plumber` API and serving the same instance, would be like:

```{r tgve, eval=FALSE}
# start a tgve instance before embedding it
ps = tgver::tgve_server(background = TRUE)
#> Attempting to serve TGVE instance from: /tmp/Rtmpevq9TT/tgve
#> Running plumber at: http://127.0.0.1/8000
knitr::include_url("http://127.0.0.1:8000")
# kill the process returned from underlying `callr`
ps$kill()
# or use the public one
# knitr::include_url("https://tgve.github.io/eatlas-template/")
```

## Remote instance
The simplest way to use the TGVE is using an instance running at a local/remote server. As of version `1.3.5-beta.0` of the TGVE (eatlas) npm package, it takes URL "query parameter" based API variables provided. Therefore, we can simply run an instance such as the `eatlas-template` instance as follows without doing anything else (again not in this Markdown doc):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# tgve = "https://tgve.github.io/eatlas-template?"
# defaultURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layik/eatlas-data/main/casualties_100.geojson"
# url = paste0(tgve, "defaultURL=", defaultURL)
# knitr::include_url(url)
# or simply
knitr::include_url("https://tgve.github.io/eatlas-template?defaultURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layik/eatlas-data/main/casualties_100.geojson")
```

What is happening there? We grab the instance, but instead of its internal values, the URL parameters takes precedence. That means the value given as `defaultURL` is parsed by the TGVE.

## Explore `sf` objects
For these purposes, the package relies on the `plumber` API to serve data. So, again within HTML outputs we can explore `sf` objects like so:

```{r explore, eval=FALSE}
# using sf
nc = sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))
tgver::explore_sf(nc)
```

## Package Status

This package is part of ongoing research at the University of Leeds, it is provided "as is" and is likely to be updated and changed without warning to meet the research needs of the University.
