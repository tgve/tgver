# tgver

This is the R package for TGVE front end `npm` package `tgve`. The R package is developed to:
1. do interactive geospatial analysis and visualization fast
2. use R's echo-system to drive (1)
3. facilitate application deployment for production

## Install
For now whilst working towards submitting it to CRAN, please use devtools:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tgve/tgver")
```

## Use
This is a Markdown (GitHub) document generatd using an Rmarkdown (Rmd) document, if the Rmd is rendered to a HTML output, then using `knitr::include_url` we should see the TGVE embedded (see the live examples in the [vignette](https://tgve.github.io/tgver/articles/tgver.html)).

```{r static, eval=FALSE}
# this is the most basic use
# tgver::tgve()
# to embed in a html rendered Rmd
html.file = tgver::tgve(browse = FALSE)
knitr::include_url(html.file)
```

The similar function, with the backend as a `plumber` API and serving the same instance, would be like:

```{r tgve, eval=FALSE}
# start a tgve instance before embedding it
ps = tgver::tgve_server(background = TRUE)
#> Attempting to serve TGVE instance from: /tmp/Rtmpevq9TT/tgve
#> Running plumber at: http://127.0.0.1/8000
knitr::include_url("http://127.0.0.1:8000")
# kill the process returned from underlying `callr`
ps$kill()
# or use the public one
# knitr::include_url("https://tgve.github.io/eatlas-template/")
```

## Explore `sf` objects
For these purposes, the package relies on the `plumber` API to serve data. So, again within HTML outputs we can explore `sf` objects like so:

```{r explore, eval=FALSE}
# using sf
nc = sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))
tgver::explore_sf(nc)
```

# Development plan
Please see the vignette called ["dev-plan"](https://tgve.github.io/tgver/articles/dev-plan.html) for details.
